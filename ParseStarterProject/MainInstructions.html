		<p>The UBIMED head shape screening test is a simple way to learn about your baby’s head shape and make the right decision with your pediatrician. </p>

		<p>A baby’s skull is very malleable during the first months of life. It is also fast growing as the brain growth pushes the skull bones. The normal baby’s head shape is not a ball but is egg shaped explaining that babies don’t usually sleep with the head strait but more often inclined on one side.</p>

		<p>According with a recent medical study, almost one baby one two has a flat head at 2 months of age due to the back sleeping position on firm mattresses for SIDS prevention, car seats, bouncers, strollers, etc.</p>

<p>The flat area is usually located on a side of the occiput and frequently centered by a bold spot. </p>

<p>This screening test will compare reported measurements with the US standards. </p>

<p>Head shape will be measured using a digital photographic caliper.</p>

<p><ol>To improve test result accuracy:
<li>- The lens of your camera must be positioned approximately 4 inches above the center of your baby’s head. </li>
<li>- Your baby’s nose should be visible on the top of the photo</li></ol></p>
